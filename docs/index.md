# About me

I am a postdoctoral research associate in the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests include large scale numerical linear algebra (theory and applications), data assimilation, and treatment of covariance matrices. Alongside my research I'm interested in outreach and scientific crafting.

# Work and education history

2019 - Present: PDRA in the School of Mathematics at The University of Edinburgh working with Dr John Pearson

Spring 2020: Semester Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics at Brown University

2015 - 2019: PhD at the University of Reading with Professor Sarah Dance, Dr Amos Lawless, Professor Nancy Nichols and Dr Joanne Waller.
