# About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computational Science group within the Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications at TU Eindhoven. My research interests include large scale numerical linear algebra (theory and applications), data assimilation, and treatment of covariance matrices. Alongside my research I'm interested in outreach and scientific crafting. Contact me at j[.]m[.]tabeart[at]tue[.]nl

# News
I've co-organised a mini-symposium on NLA for Inverse Problems with Applications to Data Assimilation and Imaging wiht Jennifer Scott at the SIAM LA meeting in Paris. Come listen to some great talks in MS69 and 76 on Wednesday.

Paper accepted at Electronic Transactions on Numerical Analysis with John W. Pearson. Read the published version [here](http://doi.org/10.1553/etna_vol60s197).

Together with Alison Ramage, Amos S. Lawless, Selime Gurol, Jennifer Scott and Melina Freitag our network on Preconditioning for Variational Data Assimilation Problems was funded by the INI Network Support for Mathematical Sciences. Find out more [here](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/mathematicsstatistics/pvdap/).

I've recently started a new position at TU Eindhoven and moved to the Netherlands! I'm looking forward to new adventures on the mathematical and geographical fronts.
