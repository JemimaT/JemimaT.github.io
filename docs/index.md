# About me

I am a Hooke Fellow in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford. My research interests include large scale numerical linear algebra (theory and applications), data assimilation, and treatment of covariance matrices. Alongside my research I'm interested in outreach and scientific crafting.

# News

I've just started a Hooke Fellowship in Oxford!

Successful grant funding from UNA Europa - Seed Funding DIGITALIZED! for the research project "Tensor-based Optimal Control approaches for Deep learning - TOC4Deep"  [Find out more here](https://site.unibo.it/toc4deep/en). See the website for information on events, and videos from past workshop talks.

I co-organised a workshop in April 2022 in Edinburgh on Recent Advances in Numerical Linear Algebra: Talks are on the website if you weren't able to join us in person https://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/2022/recent-advances-numerical-linear-algebra-pdes-optimization-and-data-assimilation
