# About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computational Science group within the Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications at TU Eindhoven. My research interests include large scale numerical linear algebra (theory and applications), data assimilation, and treatment of covariance matrices. Alongside my research I'm interested in outreach and scientific crafting. Contact me at j[.]m[.]tabeart[at]tue[.]nl and find out more about the [Computational Science group here](https://casa.win.tue.nl/home/computational-science/). I don't currently have funding for PhD students, but I have openings to supervise Bachelor and Master Final Projects -- some of the topics I am offering can be found [here](https://casa.win.tue.nl/home/m/education/project-and-internships/).

# News
Registration for Dutch Mastermath courses is now open. I'll be teaching a course on Advanced Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications (to Machine Learning and Data Assimilation) with Victorita Dolean-Maini. Find out more and enrol [here](https://elo.mastermath.nl/enrol/index.php?id=1249).

I'm giving a plenary at the Preconditioning meeting, to be held at ICMS Edinburgh in May 2026. Find out more and submit a minisymposium [here](https://icms.ac.uk/activities/workshop/precond26/)

I'm co-Chair of Section 17 on Applied and Linear Algebra at GAMM. Abstract submission has been extended to 8th January 2026, so please consider [submitting](https://jahrestagung.gamm.org/annual-meeting-2024/registration-abstract-submission/) a talk.

I've been awarded a [CoSeC fellowship](https://www.cosec.ac.uk/what-is-cosec/cosec-fellowship-programme/). I'll be using the funds to organise a hackathon at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK to extend the functionality and test cases for variational data assimilation in [Firedrake](firedrakeproject.org). More details to follow! 

Interested in better understanding the role of numerical linear algebra in data assimilation? Together with collaborators from the PVDAP network we have just posted an introductory paper aimed at those new to data assimilation [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09211).

New preprint with collaborators in Edinburgh and CERFACS looking at approximating block alpha-circulant preconditioners for all-at-once diffusion-based covariance operators [on arXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03947). For some non-technical insight into this project, I wrote a blog post for the [DARC blog](https://research.reading.ac.uk/met-darc/2025/06/18/how-computational-limitations-can-lead-to-fun-and-new-mathematics/) about how computational constraints can lead us to really interesting mathematical challenges.

I have joined the 4TU.AMI SRI in Bridging Numerical Analysis and Machine Learning. More about the Strategic Research Initiative can be found [here](https://www.4tu.nl/ami/Research/sri-bridgingNAML/)

# Other activities
I'm trying to fly less for work and personal travel, and I'm always happy to share ideas and route planning advice. I blog about my exploits via active travel and public transport at [Adventures of a Mathematician](https://lerabotproblems.wordpress.com). Some recent non-flight journeys include:
Eindhoven - Toulouse - Edinburgh - Eindhoven
Eindhoven to: Copenhagen, Vienna, Chemnitz, Geneva, Glasgow, Oxford
